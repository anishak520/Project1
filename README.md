#Project 1: Data Analysis on Food Access and Poverty Rate in Georgia Counties
##Overview
This project aims to understand the landscape of food access among different counties within Georgia. The primary focus is on investigating the relationship between poverty rates and access to food. The analysis involves data exploration, cleanup, and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib in Jupyter notebooks.

##Project Structure
Data Exploration and Cleanup Notebooks: data cleaning and exploration files can be found in each group member's individual branch on this project along with detailed processes of cleaning and formatting the dataset(s).
